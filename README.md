J. Chen, S. Yang*, C. Fahy, Z. Wang, Y. Guo, and Y. Chen, Online sparse representation clustering for evolving data streams, IEEE Trans. Neural. Netw. Learn. Syst., pp. 1-15, Oct. 2023, DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3325556

1. Please run the file ‘run_main.m’ to obtain the clustering results.
2. You may uncomment the source code block of the parameters setting to obtain the optimal parameters of OSRC on the datasets before running the file ‘run_main.m’.
3. The other datasets are available online at https://codeocean.com/capsule/2288323/tree/v4
